            <p>Nestled between rolling green hills and a jagged, mist-shrouded coastline, this land is a tapestry of bustling port towns, dense pine forests, and ancient stonework hidden beneath tangled ivy. 
                The cities hum with a blend of old-world charm and vibrant trade, their cobblestone streets alive with storytellers and merchants hawking exotic wares. 
                Farther inland, shadowy marshes and forgotten ruins whisper of secrets long buried, while majestic rivers carve pathways through the wilderness. 
                Here, the tides shape both the land and the lives of its people, who are as resilient and spirited as the ever-changing sea.</p>
            <ul id="map-locations">
                <li><b>Lennia</b>, the northern side of the coastline. In the shadow of the Crowns mountains, the temperate forests and urban industry thrive.</li>
                <li><b>Maires</b>, the southern side of the coastline. Full of rolling hills, verdant wetlands, and costal beauties, it is the birthplace of some of the first sucessful colonies.</li>
                <li><b>The Five Isles</b> were the first land masses to be colonized, specifically the shining isle of <b>Delphi</b>, and <b>Ghel</b>, the island of magic. The other islands, <b>Cairns</b>, <b>Mokk</b>, and <b>Rhin</b> are left undeveloped due to their harsh enviorments.</li>
                <li><b>The Crowns</b> is a mountain range to the north stands as a bulwark to the western frontier.</li>
                <li><b>The River Azure</b>, the largest river that feeds into the <b>Gilded Bay</b> is one of the most important features fo trade and exploration into the west.</li>
